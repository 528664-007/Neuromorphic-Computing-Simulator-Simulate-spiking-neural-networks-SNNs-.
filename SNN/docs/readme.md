# Neuromorphic Computing Simulator

A web-based simulator for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using Pyodide to run Python in the browser.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. Open `src/index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- Adjust the "Weight (w)" and "Beta" values in the "Live SNN Simulation" section.
- Click "Run Simulation" to visualize the neuron's membrane potential and spikes on the canvas.
